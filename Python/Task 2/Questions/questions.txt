Write a Python script that retrieves data from a given URL and displays relevant information. You can choose a public API or a website that provides easily accessible data.
Requirements:
	URL Selection:
●	Choose a URL that provides publicly accessible data. For example, you could use a weather API, a cryptocurrency API, or a news website that offers an API.

	HTTP Request:
●	Use the requests library in Python to make an HTTP request to the chosen URL. Handle the response appropriately.

	Data Extraction:
●	Extract relevant information from the response. For instance, if you're fetching weather data, extract temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

	Store Information:
●	Store the extracted information in a specific table.
	Error Handling:
●	Implement error handling to manage cases where the request fails or the data extraction encounters issues.
