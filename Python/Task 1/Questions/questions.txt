Create an application 'Exam' in python, which has two sections Admin and Student.
Admin:
1. Admin is responsible for managing User Login Details (Username, Password) in a csv file.
2. Create another csv file which will have Questions marked from 1 - 10.
3. Create another csv file which will have Options like MCQs marked from A to D for each question.
	Example: A:Option1,B: Option2,[C]: Option3,D: Option4

Mark correct answer with [] just like above example has [C]. 
Note: Correct answer must not be shown to Student giving exam. He must be able to see options just like below:

Question 1: Who is the second fastest batsman to reach 25 hundreds in Tests ?
A: Sachin Tendulkar								B: Alastair Cook
C: Virat Kohli									D: Steve Smith

Enter your answer: C

Answer entered by user will be compared with the file having options containing correct answer (i.e. [D]). If the answer in the file with [ ] matches the answer entered by user then give 1 marks else don't do anything.
At the end when the exam is finished, show the result to the student: "Your result : 50% Passed"

Student:
Students will be asked to enter his credentials for login:
Username and Password.
1. Compare Username and Password of the student with the file containing credentials.

b) If user enters wrong password, then it should show: Wrong Password. Please enter correct password.
	and user should be again be asked for Password.

When the exam is over, store student's result in the file containing credentials like: sachin,sachin@1234,50%

1. There should only be one correct answer in the file containing Answers.
2. There must be exactly 4 options for each question in the file containing Questions.
3. Username and Password validation.
